We welcome contributions from anybody. Contributions are and will always remain [free as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#:~:text=Thus%2C%20%E2%80%9Cfree%20software%E2%80%9D%20is,mean%20the%20software%20is%20gratis.).

We have a [github repository](https://github.com/cyclingwithelephants/devs-on-a-boat/) which we use for collaboration and hosting. We use markdown for all content so it's nice and easy.

If you're not a developer, please still get in touch! We're happy to help you contribute however you can. For example, you could send us an email to [floatingdevs@gmail.com](mailto:floatingdevs@gmail.com) with your wisdom.
