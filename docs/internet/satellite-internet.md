## Satellite internet

Starlink is a game changing proposition, with *current* beta performance
advertised as \"better than nothing\" in North America providing a
comparable connection to what I get at home. By the time I expect to be
in the water, this level of connection will be improved to cover the
vast majority of the inhabited world and improve connections such that I
would have [identical](https://www.starlink.com/faq) latency and download/upload speeds multiple times
that of my current connection.

Additionally, Coastal areas are expected to have particularly good
performance due to anticipated server load being significantly lower at
sea than on land. Solving the problem of home-schooling 5 children
*whilst on an ocean voyage* has been [described by Elon Musk as
\"relatively easy\"](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/starlink-will-it-work-on-boats), with spaceX having filed to use this technology
themselves for their autonomous spaceport droneships.

To be clear, this would likely not be a possible solution immediately
upon moving aboard; Instead I hope to highlight that we can already
exceed \"good enough\" _right now_, with the trivialisation of broadband-level
internet access at a worldwide scale being imminent. If I were writing
about internet access 1 year from now it would be *significantly*
shorter.
