## Satellite internet

Starlink is a game changing proposition, with *current* beta performance
advertised as \"better than nothing\" in North America providing a
comparable connection to what I get at home. By the time I expect to be
in the water, this level of connection will be improved to cover the
vast majority of the inhabited world and improve connections such that I
would have identical latency and download/upload speeds multiple times
that of my current connection [@starlink-FAQ].

Additionally, Coastal areas are expected to have particularly good
performance due to anticipated server load being significantly lower at
sea than on land. Solving the problem of home-schooling 5 children
*whilst on an ocean voyage* has been described by Elon Musk as
\"relatively easy\", with spaceX having filed to use this technology
themselves for their autonomous spaceport droneships
[@starlink-ocean-feasibility].

To be clear, this would likely not be a possible solution immediately
upon moving aboard; Instead I hope to highlight that we can already
exceed \"good enough\" _right now_, with the trivialisation of broadband-level
internet access at a worldwide scale being imminent. If I were writing
about internet access 1 year from now it would be *significantly*
shorter.
