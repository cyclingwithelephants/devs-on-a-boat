# Internet connectivity

Marine internet connectivity is a solved problem and implementing a
solution means following established best practices. This is getting
better and better.

My strategy in getting good internet is going to involve determining the
performance floor such that my internet connection will always be better
than calculated. It turns out that the performance floor can be
extremely high, with a higher bandwidth and identical latency to my home
broadband connection. That's right, I intend to *improve* my internet
connection by moving onto a sailboat.

To provide context for this discussion, I've been working from home with
my housemate as many have during the pandemic. We've been doing so using
an internet connection with 70Mb/s down, 18Mb/s up and 12ms latency. My
housemate is a consultant and spends approximately 6 hours
a day on zoom - he's responsible for about 70% of our bandwidth usage
(as determined by my routers QoS measurements). As such, meeting these
stats will far exceed my need and in theory a download speed above
21Mb/s would be sufficient to work from, I am however going to engineer
a solution capable of exceeding my current speeds in the interests of
quality of life.

Additionally, I spent a month during the summer of 2020 experimenting
with working portably. During this time I was using a Â£20 4GEE WiFi Mini
dongle to great success. I did not measure my connection at this point
but research suggests I was achieving around 25Mb/s down and with
approximately 50ms latency in rural York, a
location with [notably poor 4G performance](https://www.techdigest.tv/2019/12/1-in-3-constituencies-hit-by-poor-4g-and-slow-broadband.html). This proved to
be sufficient for video calls.

As a result, **the minimum internet specs that must be achieved are 25Mb/s download speed with 50ms latency.**

As a bar, I am assuming that I would need to be able to have a video
call at any point in time, this can be achieved multiple times over with
speeds of up to [100Mb/s at distances of up to 22 miles](https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/gear/the-best-boat-wi-fi-everything-you-need-to-know-about-staying-connected-onboard/) from shore using
a single 4G connection. There is no reason for me
to travel even 3 miles off-shore except when travelling between marinas
or when doing ocean voyages - I would only be doing these activities
during my own time, either weekends or agreed holiday.
