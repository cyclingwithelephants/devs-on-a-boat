# Problem statement

I'm feeling incredibly frustrated with lockdown, and the state of the
world in general. I'm 25 years old and facing a life in a concrete
jungle with overpriced everything. I grew up in London and have always
dreamed of leaving the city, I'm sure you'll understand how frustrating
therefore having to come back to the big smoke for work is. Every day I
go for a walk and must endure the constantly worsening air pollution. A
home will cost me half a million quid, at least. The golden handcuffs of
a life in tech are quite real.

This is the better way.

Boats are normally considered a luxury for the rich and, when you're
*also* paying for a house on land and a slip in a marina they are. Oh,
and boats require constant maintenance. This sounds like a recipe for
disaster right? It's not that simple, it rarely is.

The reality of the situation is that when you're living on a boat out at anchor you've
removed the largest monthly expense anyone will likely ever have - rent.

When you consider also that you're generating your own power (in a
renewable way) the monthly expenses drop considerably. As an example,
this random guy off the internet cruises at a cost of \$1000 a month on
boat related expenses. 

This is *less* than the rent I currently pay for
a house I share with my housemate in West Ham. I've also got to pay for
bills on top of that. Plus there's commuting costs. As an example, the folks at [SV Delos](https://svdelos.com/travel-blogs/afford-sail-part-2-brian/) spend around $1000/month maintaining a 53 foot sailboat.

On the flip side, there are new costs on the water. Mooring spots and slips cost money,
whether you're a transient or a permanent liveaboard. Boats require maintenance that
houses do not, and it's always more expensive. You must haul your boat out of the water
at least once a year to do annual maintenance (bottom paint, etc.), and you need somewhere
to live while that's happening - ideally near the boatyard, especially if you're doing your
own work. Sails need replacing, decks need refurbishing, masts leak, sensors fail - all of this 
must be accounted for while drawing up the budget.

But you can't put a price on freedom, can you? What's a paycheck for, anyway?
