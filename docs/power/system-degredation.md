## System Degradation

Solar panels and batteries lose their capabilities as they age, this
degradation must be taken into account so that the power solution now is
still suitable later on.

Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries for example are generally
rated to have 80% of their original capacity after 5000 discharge
cycles, that's a little over 13 years. You'll likely be replacing them
long before then.

Solar panels have a much longer lifespan with 90% generation typically
guaranteed after 10 years, and 80% generation typically guaranteed after
20 years. This of course will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, and
you may find yourself upgrading much sooner as technology advances.

Given these time frames I won't go into more detail about the long term
viability of this solution. Having to worry about this in real terms
would be a very welcome problem indeed and can be easily solved by
getting an additional solar panel wired in parallel with the rest 10
years down the line.
