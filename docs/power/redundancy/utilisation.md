### Utilisation

Since the vast majority of the boat will be standardised to 12v DC no
component is needed to interface the battery bank with any of the
electronics that utilise it, with the exception of USB C power delivery
devices as discussed below. Having no component here means it can't
fail, nice!

In the case of devices charged using the USB power delivery standard, we
will simply use multiple controllers. They nominally have 1 USB-C power
delivery port and so multiple will likely be required around the boat in
any case. Due to the nature of anything being charged in this manner
having a battery, I have no concerns about ensuring 100% up-time and
would keep a cold spare.
