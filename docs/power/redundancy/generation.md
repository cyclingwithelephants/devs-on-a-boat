### Generation

Power generation will be handled primarily by multiple solar panels,
with wind and ocean currents being used to even out generation - wind
and solar generation in particular are [well known](https://www.techdigest.tv/2019/12/1-in-3-constituencies-hit-by-poor-4g-and-slow-broadband.html) to be negatively
correlated, meaning that when one is producing
less power, the other is likely producing more.

Due to the majority of power being generated by solar we will handle
redundancy within solar generation as well as across generation types.

This is handled quite simply by stringing panels up in parallel so that,
given N panels, if any single panel fails we lose 1/Nth of our
generation capacity. 

For example, with 5 panels strung in parallel we
would lose 20% of our solar generation capacity if one were to fail.
Independent of the actual amount of generation required, using
sufficiently many solar panels ensures that a 1/Nth drop in production
does not mean eventually out of power before being able to replace the
panel, I anticipate `N = 4` is sufficient.

### Mounting

The primary difficulty in generating sufficient solar power is mounting the solar panels.
There will be a cost associated with the (likely custom) fabrication required to mount a sufficiently
large amount of solar power.
