## Redundancy

There are several levels at which the power grid must be made redundant
to ensure redundancy and durability of thegrid itself, these are:

-   generation

-   charging

-   storage

-   utilisation

With these taken care of, I will achieve a resilient power-grid capable
of supplying enough power to work indefinitely and independently of any
external sources.
