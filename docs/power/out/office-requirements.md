## Office power

My work-from-home set up currently consists of a macbook driving two 4k
27-inch monitors, with an external mouse and keyboard with a standing
desk. I will be replicating this set up in the boat. Not compromising on
a workstation is absolutely non-negotiable for me and I discuss my
workstation twice, here where I talk about the power requirements and
below in the logistics section.

I will assume that the equipment involved will be used for 12 hours a
day to simulate a particularly busy day, and perhaps with an outage that
must be attended to outside of normal working hours.

### Monitors

Each monitor draws 24 Watts nominally, with a peak power draw of 80W.
Having installed a kill-a-watt I am unsure how this 80 Watt figure was
reached since I couldn't replicate such a high draw under any
circumstances. The highest I could achieve was 42 Watts and as such will
use that figure. Two monitors drawing 42 Watts each for an extended
period of 12 hours would consume a total of 1008 Watt hours. At a
nominal draw this would consume a total of 576 Watt hours.

### Laptop

I have to make some assumptions about computer hardware since I will not
be in control of what I get, so I will assume an upper bound and behave
accordingly. A 2020 Intel based 16-inch Macbook pro has a peak power
draw of Â 40 Watts, and is the most power hungry Macbook that's currently
available. Similarly to the monitors it does not reach this 40 Watt load
unless it is working at 100%. As an upper limit, 40 Watts for 12 hours
of use gives a total daily power usage of 480 Watt hours, this is far
above what I would expect in actuality, since such a machine typically
idles at around 15 Watts, implying a daily use of 180 Watt hours.

### Networking

### Total

In total, as an upper bound the office equipment would require a maximum of 1500 Wh, and
a predicted average usage of approximately 750 Wh.
