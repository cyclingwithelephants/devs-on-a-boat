## Office power

My work-from-home set up currently consists of a macbook driving two 4k
27-inch monitors, with an external mouse and keyboard with a standing
desk. I will be replicating this set up in the boat. Not compromising on
a workstation is absolutely non-negotiable for me and I discuss my
workstation twice, here where I talk about the power requirements and
below in the logistics section.

I will assume that the equipment involved will be used for 12 hours a
day to simulate a particularly busy day, and perhaps with an outage that
must be attended to outside of normal working hours.

### Monitors

Each monitor draws 24 Watts nominally, with a peak power draw of 80W.
Having installed a kill-a-watt I am unsure how this 80 Watt figure was
reached since I couldn't replicate such a high draw under any
circumstances. The highest I could achieve was 42 Watts and as such will
use that figure. Two monitors drawing 42 Watts each for an extended
period of 12 hours would consume a total of 1008 Watt hours. At a
nominal draw this would consume a total of 576 Watt hours.

### Laptop

I have to make some assumptions about computer hardware since I will not
be in control of what I get, so I will assume an upper bound and behave
accordingly. A 2020 Intel based 16-inch Macbook pro has a peak power
draw of  40 Watts, and is the most power hungry Macbook that's currently
available. Similarly to the monitors it does not reach this 40 Watt load
unless it is working at 100%. As an upper limit, 40 Watts for 12 hours
of use gives a total daily power usage of 480 Watt hours, this is far
above what I would expect in actuality, since such a machine typically
idles at around 15 Watts, implying a daily use of 180 Watt hours.

### Total

In total, as an upper bound the office equipment would require
