## In

The following can be considered reliable sources of power, roughly in order of 
generating capacity:

-   Shore power (110/220VAC), infinite so long as you pay the bills

-   Boat diesel motor alternator (assume 80A 13.8 VDC alternator)

-   Inboard diesel generator

-   Solar power (highly variable based on location, but easily upgraded)

-   Wind turbine (~40 watts in 12 knots; 200 watts in 20 knots of wind per [sailmagazine](https://www.sailmagazine.com/diy/know-how-wind-generators))

-   Saildrive (boat speed must exceed 6 knots for 1000W)

-   Emergency diesel generator

-   Towable (hydrogenerators)[https://www.sailmagazine.com/diy/know-how-hydro-generators]

When calculating power usage, remember that all of these systems convert down to 12VDC (really 13.8) to charge the house & starter battery banks, and require an inverter to produce AC power (110VAC or 220VAC, as you like)
